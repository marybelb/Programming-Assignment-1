# Programming-Assignment-1
Write C++ code for solving the following problems related to data types, operations, if statements, simple loops, and basic functions.

Q1: Shortest Distance from a Point to a Line

Write a program that reads three x, y coordinates from the console (STDIN). The first two coordinates will be used to compute an equation of a straight line passing through each coordinate. The program should then calculate the shortest distance from the third coordinate to the line and print the result to the console (STDOUT).

Q2: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Write a program to play “rock, paper, scissors”. In this game, you first prompt the user to choose “rock, paper, or scissors”. After this, the computer should randomly generate one of these three. Then you should display the choice of the computer and determine the winner (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock).

Q3. Hamming Distance

In information theory, the Hamming distance between two sequences of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. Put another way, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the number of errors that transform one string into the other. Examples: The Hamming distance between: • "toned" and "roses" is 3. • 1011101 and 1001001 is 2. • 2173896 and 2233796 is 3. (Description above is from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance ) Write a program that prompts the user to enter two positive integers (in decimal; up to 32-bits of precision) and computes the Hamming distance between the two numbers when the numbers are represented in base-16 (hex format). The program then displays the Hamming distance on the screen.

Q4. Palindromic Number Strings

A palindromic number (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome) is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. Like 16461 or 123321. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number string and determines whether or not the number is a palindrome. The number entered by the user should only contain digits 0-9 and should return false if any invalid characters are entered.

Q5. Letter Conversion

Write code that asks the user to enter a character. Then the program asks the user to enter a nonnegative integer offset. This program adds the offset to the character to produce a new ASCII value. This value should then be displayed. If the offset is 0 and the character is a letter, the program should change the case of the letter. (“Change case” means that a lowercase letter should be converted to uppercase, and an uppercase letter should be changed to lowercase.) If the offset is 0 but the character is not a letter, the same character should be displayed.
